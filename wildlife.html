It gives us food, medicines and materials, and supports millions of jobs. It also inspires people around tBhe world – making our lives richer in all sorts of ways. 

But our planet’s wildlife is in crisis – numbers have fallen by more than half since 1970, and species are going extinct at an alarming rate.

We need to reverse this loss of nature and create a future where wildlife and people thrive again.</font></td>
